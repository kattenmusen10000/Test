Artist: Scissor Sisters 
Song: I Don't Feel Like Dancin' 

Lyrics:

Wake up in the morning with a head like 'what ya done?' 
This used to be the life but I don't need another one. 
Good luck cuttin' nothin', carrying on, you wear them gowns. 
So how come I feel so lonely when you're up getting down? 

So I play along when I hear that favourite song 
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right. 
You better know when you're swingin' round the room 
Look's like magic's solely yours tonight 

But I don't feel like dancin' 
When the old Joanna plays 
My heart could take a chance 
But my two feet can't find a way 
You think that I could muster up a little soft, shoop devil sway 
But I don't feel like dancin' 
No sir, no dancin' today. 

Don't feel like dancin', dancin' 
Even if i find nothin' better to do 
Don't feel like dancin', dancin' 
Why'd you break down when I'm not in the mood? 
Don't feel like dancin', dancin' 
Rather be home with no one when I can't get down with you 

Cities come and cities go just like the old empires 
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile. 
You got so many colours make a blind man so confused. 
Then why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I lose? 

So I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend 
And I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine. 
Just please understand, when I see you clap your hands 
If you stick around I'm sure that I'll be fine. 

But I don't feel like dancin' 
When the old Joanna plays 
My heart could take a chance 
But my two feet can't find a way 
You think that I could muster up a little soft, shoop devil sway 
But I don't feel like dancin' 
No sir, no dancin' today. 

Don't feel like dancin', dancin' 
Even if i find nothin' better to do 
Don't feel like dancin', dancin' 
Why'd you break down when I'm not in the mood? 
Don't feel like dancin', dancin' 
Rather be home with no one when I can't get down with you 

You can't make me dance around 
But your two-step makes my chest pound. 
Just lay me down as you blow it away into the shimmer light. 

But I don't feel like dancin' 
When the old Joanna plays 
My heart could take a chance 
But my two feet can't find a way 
You think that I could muster up a little soft, shoop devil sway 
But I don't feel like dancin' 
No sir, no dancin' today. 

Don't feel like dancin', dancin' 
Even if i find nothin' better to do 
Don't feel like dancin', dancin' 
Why'd you break down when I'm not in the mood? 
Don't feel like dancin', dancin' 
Rather be home with no one when I can't get down with you
