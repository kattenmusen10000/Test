Six Pence Non the ritcher - Busses and Traines.

So I walked under a bus, 
I got hit by a train, 
Keep fallin' in love, 
Which is kind of the same, 
I've sunk out at sea, 
crashed my car, 
gone insane, 
And it felt so good, 
I wanna do it again. 

Hey Mom, 
why didn't you warn me? 
'Cause about boys there's something I should have known, 
They're like chocolate cake, 
like cigarettes, 
I know they're bad for me but I just can't leave 'em alone.
